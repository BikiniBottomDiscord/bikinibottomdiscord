### Behavior:
Has the exact same behavior as an average pink jelly has.

### Notes:
This rare jelly is a pink jelly but isn't the color pink. It was born looking different due to a birth defect causing it to look white and barely translucent. Finding one of these out in the wild is considered a once in a life time event.
