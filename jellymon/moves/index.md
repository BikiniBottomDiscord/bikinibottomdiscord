### Guide to Jellymon moves
Every move is different, and every Jellymon only gets to bring four into a battle! So how can you determine what the best-in-slot moves? Consider move typing, accuracy, base power, and categories.

Accuracy and base power are the central stats of every move: Higher base power moves inflict more damage, and higher accuracy moves more reliably connect with the target.

Move types function similarly to species types - always aim for supereffective hits! In addition, if a Jellymon's move type and species type match, the power of the move will increase!

There are 3 main move categories:
1. Physical
2. Special
3. Status

A physical move uses a Jellymon's stingers, so a higher stinger count will deal higher damage! Special moves deal damage proportional to the toxicity stat, similarly to toxic players! Status moves can change the pace of a battle by inflicting stat drops, status conditions, or self-heals. Never underestimate these!

In addition, many moves come with additional effects affecting the frequency of critical hits, flinching to make the opposing Jellymon lose a turn, and many more! Be warned, however, that stronger moves have a higher chance to miss their target!
