### Clubs
On top of the three factions, there are 5 clubs: one for each faction, one club for mods, and one special restricted club.

Being the top ranked licensed Jellymon member in your faction will earn you the title of being a Club Master. Being a Club Master comes with perks: increased XP, rewards, and of course valor. Defeating a Club Master in battle or ranked battle also rewards you with bonus rewards and XP, so be sure to challenge them!
