### Wild Battles
Battling wild Jellymon is the core of the game. Talking in any public channel will get you a chance of spawning a specific type of Jellymon. There are many types of activities throughout our Discord server, discover them all and discover what channels spawn what types!

If activity is not your thing, no worries! Every 3 hours you can react at the bottom of **#convention-center** to get a free random spawn courtesy of Kevin the Cucumber and his associates!

When a wild Jellymon spawns in your DMs, fight them with your team. The higher level you are, the harder the spawned Jellymons will be. If you faint the Wild Jellymon, your Jellymon will get XP gains! If you however capture the Jellymon (using Jars, or JM10 items), the Jellymon will be placed in your Jellymon Vault for use later!

If you do not want to have Wild Jellymons spawning anymore, you can toggle this with `!togglepve`


### PVP Battles
Player vs Player Battles, or PVP, is the most exciting feature. Think your team is superior? `!battle` or `!ranked` battle an opponent to see who will come out on top!

If you do not want to battle other players and deny all battle requests, you can toggle this by typing `!togglepvp`
