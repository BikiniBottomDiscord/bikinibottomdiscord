### Intro
No two Jellymon are created equal - each Jellymon at it's core is one specific specie. There are 67 of them currently, however each possesses a unique set of types, stats, and moves!
 

### Stats
All Jellymon have 5 different stats to consider: Health (HP), Stinger Count, Epidermal Thickness, Toxicity, and Swimming Speed.
- HP determines the amount of damage a Jellymon can take before passing out; usually higher HP Jellymons are able to take more hits.
- Stinger Count determines how powerful physical moves are; raise this to make your stings hurt more!
- Epidermal Thickness expresses how well a Jellymon can take physical hits, the thicker the better!
- Toxicity measures how potent a Jellymon's special attacks will be, and will neutralize the toxins from other Jellymon. A more toxic Jellymon will be capable of dealing as much damage as it can take!
- Swimming Speed determines the speed of the Jellymon, which dictates turn order in a battle; faster swimmers will move first!


### XP, Levels, and Evolutions
All Jellymons come with a level and XP. Earn XP to increase your level; increase your level to evolve your Jellymon. Evolving your Jellymons changes its species to a new one, however it keeps its previous stats. Typically, evolved Jellymon are more powerful than their pre-evolution counterparts.


### Types
Every type has strengths and weaknesses against the other types, with the exception of the fighting type. Type advantage moves will deal double damage, while disadvantaged types will deal half damage. Some types have immunities, meaning that they will take no damage and other types can stack, or be multiplied together.

You can figure out a move-to-jellymon typing by looking for its effectiveness description after a hit. They are:
- whoosh - 0% effective
- zp - 25% effective
- bzp - 50% effective
- zap - 100% effective
- brzap - 200%% effective
- BRZAP - 400% effective


### Index
<sup>note from Rev: I have no idea how this is best broken down. Ideally we'll have either a page for each mon, a page for each evolutionary chain, or a page for each TYPE with a lot of different mons. Either way, this is probably going to be the biggest section.</sup>
